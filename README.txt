This SSD1351_t3 is a copy of Adafruit's 1.8" & 1.44" SSD1351 library
optimized for use with Teensy 3.x boards.

----------------------------

This is a library for the Adafruit SSD1351 based displays

This library works with the Adafruit 1.5" OLED breakout board
  ----> http: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1431

And should work with their other SSD1351 dispolays such as
The 1.27" OLED Breakout Board:
  ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/1673

And maybe the .96" one based on the SSD1331 
but I don't have one to try it out.

Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required
to interface (RST is optional).
